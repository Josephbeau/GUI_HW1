Joseph Beausoleil, UMass Lowell Computer Science, Joseph_Beausoleil@uml.edu
This is my first Web Page for this class. It is used as a small history of the roman empire. For this page I needed:
Some informative reading/interesting site to browse
• 2-3 Working links
• 2-3 Images
• 1-2 Tables
• Good styling with basic CSS

        <p>My name is Joseph Beausoleil, I am an avid reader of history, especially but not limited to Roman history. 
          I made my website as a small introduction to what Roman history looks like. This is a very small look and 
          a very general overview as i didnt think it was necessary to tell the whole history of Rome on a small page 
          made for a first homework assignment.</p>

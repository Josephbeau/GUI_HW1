        <h3>The Empire</h3>
        <p>The Roman Empire was founded by Octavian Caesar, Augustus, in the year 27 BC. Following the Death of his 
            Uncle Julius Caesar Augustus was thrown into a war with Mark Anthoney and Cleopatra. This war resulted 
            in the death of both Anthoney and Cleopatra, the capture of Egypt for the empire, a major source of food 
            that fed the whole empire and was a major catalyst in its expansion, and instillining Augustus as the Princepts 
            of the Empire meaning “First Citizen”. Augustus was known for acting as the head of state and an elected 
            official while pulling the strings in the back of the Senate. Contrary to popular belief Rome was not always 
            an “empire” it was a Kingdom when the city of Rome was first founded in 743 BC and it became a republic in 509 
            BC. Even after the Founding of the Empire the Senate was still intact for the rest of the empire’s existence, 
            even if they were just a figurehead under the emperor.This system would continue for almost 400 years. Until 
            the Fall of the Western Empire in 476 under the emperor Romulus Augustus.</p>

        <h5><b>Augustus</b></h5>
        <p>Emperor Augustus was born in 63 BC, he would struggle with sickness his whole life and would often be considered 
            a coward for always suddenly “falling ill” on the eve of battle. Much of the political infrastructure created 
            by Julius Caesar would be used by Augustus to ease himself and his descendants into power.</p>

        <h5><b>Rome at its peek</b></h5>
        <p>The Map of the Roman Empire at its largest is a screenshot of the rule of Trajan. After his conquest of 
            Mesopotamia the empire would  be at its largest and most prosperous era. Trajan marks the middle of the 
            era known as “The Five Great Emperors”. This peak wouldn’t last long as the emperor Hadrian would pull 
            out of Mesopotamia right after Trajan's death.</p>
